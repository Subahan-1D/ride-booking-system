# Ride Booking API

### **🎯 Project Overview**

Design and build a **secure, scalable, and role-based backend API** for a **ride booking system** (like Uber, Pathao) using **Express.js** and **Mongoose**.

Your task is to implement a system where **riders** can request rides, **drivers** can accept and complete rides, and **admins** can manage the overall system.

You must implement:

- 🔐 Authentication
- 🎭 Role-based Authorization
- 🧍 Rider & Driver Logic
- 🚗 Ride Management Logic
- 📦 Modular Code Architecture
- 🔁 Proper API Endpoints

While the **system design is up to you**, the implementation **must include the following minimum requirements**.
